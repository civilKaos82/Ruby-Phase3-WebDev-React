	- Do the exercises in the slides using these [practice files](http://girldevelopit.github.io/gdi-featured-intermediate-html-css/workshop-files.zip)

**OR**

### Check different sizes and devices

How does it look when
- on your phone
- on a tablet
- on really wide screen
- resized really small
- the user agent is changed in your browser (see additional resources)

You can try using [QuirkTools](http://quirktools.com/screenfly) to see a site in multiple browsers.

### Reset alternatives
