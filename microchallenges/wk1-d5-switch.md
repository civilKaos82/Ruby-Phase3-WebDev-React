# Welcome to Thunderdome!

You've spent the last 2 days building an application with your group. We've asked that you focus on quality (full testing) rather than producing a laundry list of features. Today we'll put that discipline to the test.

## Step 1: Swap projects

Group 1 -> Group 3
Group 2 -> Group 4
Group 3 -> Group 5
Group 4 -> Group 1
Group 5 -> Group 2

E.g. Group 1 should fork Group 3's project and work out of the fork.

## Step 2: Delete your models and migrations

## Step 3: Reorient and start making progress

Now that you've inherited someone else's code, the first thing is to run the tests.

````
git clone <repo-url>
git checkout day-5
bundle exec rake spec
````

Sometimes when you download other people's code it doesn't work â€“ in this case we've manufactured that situation. Now it's time to fix the tests. Once you've fixed the tests (they're all green), submit a Pull Request to the `day-5` branch and tag your instructors.

## Step 4: Instructor Review

Come find your instructor. Once we've reviewed your progress we'll give you further instruction.
