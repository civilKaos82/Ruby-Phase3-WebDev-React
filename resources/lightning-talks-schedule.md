# Lightning Talks Schedule

No talks after Wednesday due to final projects.

Do not just 'show the readme' or something. Build out some code, walk us through how it works. 

Point out the aweosme parts and potential pitfalls to avoid.  

A slide deck with code snippets is OK if you post them to slack after your talk.
