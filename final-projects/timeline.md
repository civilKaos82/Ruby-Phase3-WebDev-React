# Final Project Timeline & Milestones

## Day 1 | Wednesday

- Set your team's workflow, process and guidelines.
- Set a schedule for team standups (cohort standups are already fixed).
- As a group, figure out and agree upon what you're building.
- Begin researching your project ideas and any special technologies you might need to make it work.
- Build a backlog of the user stories that you want to implement.

## Day 2 | Thursday

Find any technologies that you haven't worked with, unfamiliar concepts that you don't understand, or anything that scares you about what you're planning to build - and spike on it.

**What's a spike?**

It's a test to see how difficult an idea might be to work with. You give yourself a timebox (for example, two hours) and you go exploring. You try to prove the concept in that timebox. You don't write tests, you don't try to write features. At the end of the two hours, you throw all the code away from your spike - because it was just a proof-of-concept.

Now you have a good set of learning, and you're ready to build the feature from scratch!

## Day 3 | Friday

- Get your project immediately deployed and set up with a continuous integration tool.
- Focus on the hardest problem in your MVP, finish it, repeat.
