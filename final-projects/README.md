# Final Projects

[Welcome to the Grind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbkZrOU1Zag)

Project pitches will occur first thing.  After pitches, you'll all vote on project preferences.  Your instructors will assign each of you to a final project group, trying to give everyone their first or second preferences.

The [Final Projects timeline](timeline.md) has been provided to you, and it is strongly recommended that you follow it. Not only to ensure that you have a great project at the end, but also so that you have a great set of learning experiences to talk about with employers.

### Tips

- Establish your team processes and guidelines first. This will set expectations within your team correctly.
- Use your instructors for opinions, philosophy and general advice, not implementation help or technical support. Make sure that you use them frequently though!
- If you're stuck on a technical issue, reach out to your team. If you're still stuck at the next cohort standup, bring it up and get some help from your instructors. (They'll help with code after standups, just not for adhoc questions.)
