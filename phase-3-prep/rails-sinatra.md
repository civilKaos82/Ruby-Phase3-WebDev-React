# Rails

---

## what is it?

- open-source web app framework written in Ruby (duh)
- convention over configuration (CoC)
- "fat models, skinny controllers"
- employs MVC architectural pattern
- David Heinemeier Hansson created it in 2004 after substantial work on 37signals' Basecamp product

---

## what is it?

- development was expedited in 2006 when Apple announced Ruby would ship with all OSX installs
- features have changed drastically between major versions
- more than 600,000 websites run some version of RoR

---

# conventions

- Rails expects things to adhere to specific structures/hierarchies, naming schemes, and use cases
- intent is to make it quicker to get up-and-running; down that customization of app configuration, structure, and deployment technique is rather painful

---

# conventions

- conventions and best practices have changed as version has increased
- **many** resources exist on Ruby/Rails best practices and "up-to-date" conventions

# vs. sinatra
<br>

### Rails (1.38 MB) vs. Sinatra (339 KB) 


### Rails (100,000 LoC) vs. Sinatra (2,000 LoC)

---

## which and why?
- Sinatra, being so small and lightweight, most often tends to be used for REST API back-ends, leveraging a thick clienet (single-page app) in the browser.

- These applications tend not to require the extensive Helper and View systems in Rails, and may utilize third-party gems to extend Sinatra's core functionality.

---

## which and why?

- Rails, being the monolith that it is, most often tends to be used for fully-fledged server-side MVC applications, taking advantage of Railsâ€™ extensive Helper and View systems
- As well as its advanced built-in testing functionality, expansive security precautions, and easy-to-use generators and scaffolds
