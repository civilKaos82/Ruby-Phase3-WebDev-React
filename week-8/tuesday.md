### React (1/2)

### Core

**Challenges**

- [Lil Twitter React](../../../../lil-twitter-react-challenge) using [react-rails][]. [react-rails][] does the transpilation of ES6, installs React and integrates that work into Rails' Asset Pipeline. We used primitive tools so you could understand (and interview!) well about Node and React. `react-rails` gives you all the support and goodness of `rake`, Rails, and Rails' conventions _but also_ provides support for integrating React for free. It's nice. You can use react-rails and unify all the concepts we've been working with in Phase 3.

### Very Advanced Patterns in JavaScript

While some JavaScript patterns are going away with the incorporation of ES6,
there are a few that you need to know for interviews and for when you encounter
legacy code.

* JavaScript Module Pattern
* IIFE (Instantly Invoked Function Expression)

Make sure you can implement these.
