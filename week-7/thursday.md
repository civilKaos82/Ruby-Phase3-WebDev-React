**Prep for Tomorrow**

As we close out our work on building a Rails project, we're now going to pivot
to talking about JavaScript. JavaScript, as you know, rides on top of content
delivered by a web server, in our case, Rails.

We will be exploring advanced frameworks that organize and discipline our use of
JavaScript. Our focus will be React. We will also introduce another popular web
server paradigm: NodeJS.

Both the NodeJS ecosystem and React are advanced usages of JavaScript. **YOUR USE
OF THEM WITHOUT GRASP OF THE FIVE POINTS LISTED BELOW WILL NOT BE SUFFICIENT
TO LAND YOU A JOB.** While employers and future team-mates love to see a lively
portfolio site with the latest technology you have used, we can assure you that
your interview will involve explaining your grasp of one if not all of these
concepts. Engage with this material deeply for it is key to getting the most
out of your time studying these concepts at DBC.

Get an objective measure of your comfort with the [JavaScript Interview Exercise](https://github.com/nyc-coyotes-2016/p2-javascript-interview-exercises/blob/master/javascript-fundamentals.md)
