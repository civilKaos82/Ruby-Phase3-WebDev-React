**Prep for Tomorrow**

As we close out our work on building a Rails project, we're now going to pivot
to talking about JavaScript. JavaScript, as you know, rides on top of content
delivered by a web server, in our case, Rails.

In order to talk about advanced web frameworks, we need to understand a few of the
**most difficult** topics about how JavaScript works. Unsurprisingly, questions
around these topics are usually the ones used to weed-out interview candidates.
You could know React and Angular 2 backward and forward, but I would contend
that anyone claiming to "know" JavaScript but who couldn't answer this would
not move past me in the interview process.

Get an objective measure of your comfort with the [JavaScript Interview Exercise](https://github.com/nyc-coyotes-2016/p2-javascript-interview-exercises/blob/master/javascript-fundamentals.md)

Note any weakness and see if you an address it with the help of the following
resources. If you require further help, bring questions to school tomorrow.
