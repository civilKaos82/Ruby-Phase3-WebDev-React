## Weekend

### Core

**Talks**

Choose a New Technology Exploration Talks and prepare your lightning talk.

For ideas see [Gemsy Talk Topic](../resources/gemsy_talk_topics.md)

**Rails Checkpoint**

Work on this solo [rails checkpoint
challenge](../../../../rails-checkpoint-challenge) and submit a PR for review
when you are finished.  Please finish it before Monday. You should observe the
same care and discipline that you observed in the group project. This solo
project, the group project, and what you learn in your final projects will
define what you're able to talk about in your interviews. If you coasted in
some place, here's the time to fix it. If someone else in your team implemented
a feature that you weren't engaged in, dig in and figure it out (refactor it?
write tests for it?) until you're _as good as the originator_.

Great developers are always learning from each other and using the code to
commune with other minds.

**Firm Up ES6 Syntax**

Firm up your mastery of the JavaScript thorny points and practice using ES6.
Build trivial apps where you get to try out new ES6 SUPER POWERS. Make sure you
can model a `Dog` or a `Guitar` using the new `class` syntax. Revisit ideas
from assessments and see if you can make them just as easily in ES6 syntax.

Make sure you understand the relationship between words like _transpilation_
and _Babel_.

**TODO**: Are these teh techs we're going with?

**Solo Project**

Take this opportunity to start investigating what you will pitch for final project and the feasibility.
