### Beginning Server-Side JavaScript: The NodeJS Runtime, `npm`, and ES6

### Core

- Demo
  - Show the app
  - Show your beautiful tests!
  - Show your beautiful `git log --graph` so we can see your mastery of git workflow

**Q&A**

- Preparatory topics from yesterday:
  - Scope
  - Closures
  - `this`, `bind`, `call`, `apply`
  - Event Loop
  - Promises

### Abstraction, Runtimes, and the [NodeJS][] Runtime: Learning Objectives

* Define _abstraction_
* Position technologies on a scale of abstraction
* Define _runtime_
* Define _standard library_
* Identify host objects (DOM/[Node][NodeJS]) versus native objects
* Create an introductory [NodeJS][] application with access to the `npm` ecosystem
* Use ES6 to build out a JavaScript implementation that passes tests written in Mocha

** Challenges **

* Build a NodeJS App and TDD an App using ES6 (newest JavaScript Standard): [Built a NodeJS sandbox in which to TDD "drive" an a model built in ES6](../../../../nodejs-sandbox-and-tdd-es6-model-challenge)
* Take a Phase 1 challenge (Week 1 or Week 2) and migrate it to NodeJS; Build a web server that honors RESTful conventions

**Stretch**

Continue exploring the [ES6 and ES6 feature list][es6f] and build toy applications
to test your understanding. Developers do this **all the time** when learning new
technology. You now have the skills to run pretty much any Phase 1
or Phase 2 challenge in the NodeJS universe (although figuring out an ORM to talk
to Postgres might be a challenge, it's certainly possible!).
